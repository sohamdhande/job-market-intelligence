## Job Market Intelligence Platform

Students preparing for internships and entry-level software roles often lack
clear, data-backed insight into which technical skills and skill combinations
are actually demanded by the job market.

This project builds an end-to-end job market intelligence system that collects
real internship and entry-level job postings, cleans and structures the data,
and analyzes skill demand, skill combinations, and location-wise trends.

The system also allows users to input their current skills and computes a
skill gap percentage against market demand.

The project is built using Python, Pandas, Flask, PostgreSQL, and a simple
HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard, and is fully deployed.

## Explicit Non-Goals

- No machine learning models
- No Selenium or browser automation
- No frontend frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- No synthetic or fake data
- No over-engineered system design
